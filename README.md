# Whitespace Theme

[[https://github.com/craigsimps/whitespace/raw/master/develop/images/screenshot.png]]

This theme is currently in use on my website, [craigsimpson.scot](https://craigsimpson.scot). It's a custom built Genesis child theme, and although it started out as the Whitespace Pro theme from StudioPress, it has developed into a much more advanced fork.

Using [Genesis Theme Toolkit](https://github.com/gamajo/genesis-theme-toolkit) to provide a solid platform of config based customization, and [Gulp WP Toolkit](https://github.com/craigsimps/gulp-wp-toolkit) for a powerful build workflow, the theme is lightweight and performs very well.
